# TEXT-FUNCTIONS

<b>What are TEXT functions?</b><br>
Excel is mostly about the numerical data, but at times you can come across the data which has too much text and that is the time when Text Functions in Excel will help you to simplify the things easily.<br>

<b>Usage Scenarios:</b><br>
-Conversion from lower case to upper case.<br>
-Used to find the substring withing a string.<br>
-Used to extract substring from a string.<br>
-List specific words or characters from a string.<br>

<b>LEN Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel LEN function returns the length of the specified string.<br>

<b>TRIM Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel TRIM function returns a text value with the leading and trailing spaces removed. You can also use the TRIM functions to remove unnecessary spaces between words in a string.<br>

<b>UPPER Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel UPPER function allows you to convert text to all uppercase.<br>

<b>LOWER Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel LOWER function allows you to convert to all lowercase.<br>

<b>SUBSTITUTE Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel SUBSTITUTE function replaces a set of characters with another.<br>
>Parameters<br>
text â€“ The original string to use to perform the substitution.<br>
old_text â€“ The existing characters to replace.<br>
new_text â€“ The new characters to replace old_text with.<br>
nth_appearance â€“ Optional. It is the nth appearance of old_text that you wish to replace. If this parameter is omitted, then every occurrence of old_text will be replaced with new_text.<br>

<b>REPLACE Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel REPLACE function replaces a sequence of characters in a string with another set of characters.<br>
>Parameters<br>
old_text â€“ The original string value.<br>
start â€“ The position in old_text to begin replacing characters.<br>
number_of_chars â€“ The number of characters to replace in old_text.<br>
new_text â€“ The replacement set of characters.<br>

<b>FIND Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel FIND function returns the locations of a substring in a string. The search is case sensitive.<br>
>Parameters<br>
substring â€“ The substring that you want to find.<br>
string â€“ The string to search within.<br>
start_position â€“ Optional. It is the position in the string where the search will start. The first position is 1. If the start position is not provided, the FIND function will start the search at the beginning of the string.<br>

<b>LEFT Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel LEFT function allows you to extract a substring from a string, starting from the left most character.<br>
>Parameters<br>
text â€“ The string that you wish to extract from.<br>
number_of_characters â€“ Optional. It indicates the number of characters. If this parameter is omitted, only 1 character is returned.<br>

<b>RIGHT Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel RIGHT function allows you to extract a substring from a string, starting from the left most character.<br>
>Parameters<br>
text â€“ The string that you wish to extract from.<br>
number_of_characters â€“ Optional. It indicates the number of characters. If this parameter is omitted, only 1 character is returned.<br>

<b>MID Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel MID function extracts a substring from a string (starting at any position).<br>
>Parameters<br>
text â€“ The string that you wish to extract from.<br>
start_position â€“ The position in the string that you will begin extracting from. The first position in the string is 1.<br>
number_of_characters â€“ The number of characters that you wish to extract. It is mandatory when the MID function is used as a Worksheet function, but optional in VBA. (if you omit this parameter in VBA, the MID function will return all characters after the start_postion).<br>

<b>CONCATENANTE Function</b><br>
The Microsoft Excel CONCATENATE function allows you to join 2 or more strings together.<br>

# LOGICAL-FUNCTIONs
<b>What are logical functions?</b><br>
-A LOGICAL FUNCTION is one that evaluates an expression and returns a Boolean result. <br>
>-For example, imagine a series of cells that represent employees last name. If you are interested to know which cell doesn't have a name, you can use a function. <br>
>-On the other hand, imagine you have a cell that is supposed to indicate when must you receive a discount, you can use a conditional function to check it. <br>

-Most, if not all, logical functions check a condition and render a result. <br>

<b>IF Function</b><br>
-The Microsoft Excel IF function returns one value if the condition is TRUE, or another value if the condition is FALSE <br>
>Syntax <br>
>=IF( condition, value_if_true, [value_if_false])
![image](https://github.com/ralphgrm/Practice-of-text-math-and-logical-functions/assets/134179620/4154be65-e52a-4c23-879a-a44715030295)


<b>AND Function</b><br>
-The Microsoft Excel AND function returns TRUE if all arguments evaluate TRUE else return FALSE. <br>
>Syntax <br>
>=AND(condition1, [condition2], ...)<br>
![image](https://github.com/ralphgrm/Practice-of-text-math-and-logical-functions/assets/134179620/fd26be52-ce70-4387-a3af-824f907415e0)


<b>OR Function</b><br>
-The OR function in Excel returns TRUE if any of the conditions are true and returns FALSE if all conditions are false. <br>
>Syntax <br>
>=OR( condition1, [condition2, ... condition_n])<br>
![image](https://github.com/ralphgrm/Practice-of-text-math-and-logical-functions/assets/134179620/78b0527a-6bbd-447d-b5a4-3c62dcdadc91)


<b>NOT Function</b><br>
-The Microsoft Excel NOT function is used to check if one value is not equal to another If we give TRUE, it will return FALSE and when given FALSE, it will return TRUE. <br>
>Syntax <br>
>=NOT(logical)<br>
![image](https://github.com/ralphgrm/Practice-of-text-math-and-logical-functions/assets/134179620/c106a76e-3f08-4d84-b756-1da246e2e6bf)


<b>XOR Function</b><br>
-The XOR Function was introduced in Excel 2013 and is available under Excel Logical functions. It is a logical "exclusive OR" function.<br>
-For two given logical statements, the XOR function would return TRUE if one of the statements is true and FALSE if both statements are true. If neither of the statements is true, it also returns FALSE. <br>
>Syntax<br>
>=XOR(logical1, [logical2],...)<br>
![image](https://github.com/ralphgrm/Practice-of-text-math-and-logical-functions/assets/134179620/4a85c07e-3459-45fe-904d-58ad825fda66)

<b>IFERROR Function</b><br>
-The Microsoft Excel IFERROR function returns an alternate value if a formula results in an error.<br>
-It will check for errors such as #N/A, #VALUE!, #REF!, #DIV/O!, #NUM!, #NAME? or #NULL <br>
>Syntax <br>
>=IFERROR (value, value_if_error)<br>
![image](https://github.com/ralphgrm/Practice-of-text-math-and-logical-functions/assets/134179620/7ba7a8bd-ba21-464d-a476-38693a5d6240)


<b>SUMIF Function</b><br>
-You use the SUMIF function to sum the values in a range that meet criteria that you specify. <br>
-For example, suppose that in a column that contains numbers, you want to sum only the values that are larger than 5. You can use the following formula: =SUMIF(B2:B25,">5")<br>
>Syntax<br>
>=SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])<br>
![image](https://github.com/ralphgrm/Practice-of-text-math-and-logical-functions/assets/134179620/791f57cb-112a-4bdc-a302-7dfd7b34841d)


<b>COUNTIF Function</b><br>
